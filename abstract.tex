\chapter*{ABSTRACT}

\noindent System on a Chip (SoC) is an embedded system module
Has a certain functionality in a silicon chip board that can also be called
With Veri Large Scale Integration (VLSI). The owner of the SoC design has
Copyright over the system design that has been created. Fabless manufacturing is
How to mold a hardware module that is designer Integrated Circuit (IC)
Is Outsourching from outside the printing factory.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent Fabless manufacturing from IC design has gap design theft
When the design will be printed or when the project requires mutiple module
With various functions from various designers. Therefore every module is VLSI
From this chip designer requires proof of ownership from the designer or
Production company.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent In this study plans to make a verification of ownership design
With 2 dedicated verification keys ie Polygate as the primary key going
Activate the second key, and the second key will be active which process
Using a digital filter algorithm.
